Minimal dash to keep an eye on Ethereum's gas price

Background will change to colour2 when propose price is below value set in top left textbox, and will flash between colour1 and colour2 when below value in top right textbox.

Just to be run locally for now, requires an etherscan API key, "apiKey", to be set in a file called apiKey.js
